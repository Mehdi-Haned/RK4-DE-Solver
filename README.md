# RK4-DE-Solver
This is a solver for nth order systems of differential equations using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for solving systems of DEs

Overview.ipynb contains extensive documentation and ways to help analayse the error in my solver vs that of scipy.integrate.odeint or any other solver
or your chosing. I tried to be thorough with the documentation.

Please report any bugs
