# RK4-DE-Solver
This is a solver for nth order systems of differential equations using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for solving systems of DEs

Overview.ipynb contains extensive documentation and ways to help analayse the error in my solver vs that of scipy.integrate.odeint or any other solver
or your chosing. I tried to be thorough with the documentation.

RK4 has the actual code. I know this is not the most efficient approach to code this method, I aimed for constancy with the scipy.integrate.odeint function so that
I can debug easier. If you have any advice for a better apprach please let me know.

Please report any bugs
